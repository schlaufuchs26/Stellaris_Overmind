"""
Outcome Scorer — Evaluates how good a decision was after the fact.

Takes a DecisionRecord with both ``state_before`` and ``state_after`` filled
and produces numeric scores across multiple dimensions.

Scoring philosophy:
  - We measure *deltas* (how much did things change after the decision)
  - We measure *meta alignment* (did the decision follow the curated meta)
  - We measure *survival* (is the empire still alive / growing)
  - We do NOT score based on hidden information (fog-of-war safe)

Scores are normalized to [-1.0, +1.0] where:
  - +1.0 = excellent outcome
  -  0.0 = neutral / no change
  - -1.0 = terrible outcome

The composite score is a weighted sum used to rank decisions for training.
