# Stellaris 4.4.6 – Personality System
Defines how the LLM simulates human‑like strategic behavior using personality shards,
multi-agent council, and Clausewitz AI personality overrides.

For **AI empires**, the personality system steers Stellaris’ native AI via personality
overrides + stat modifiers — the LLM decides macro strategy while the native AI
handles micro (build queues, research, fleets).

For the **player**, the personality system produces strategic suggestions displayed
in the Rich TUI.

```
ACTION: <one>
TARGET: <optional>
REASON: <merged reasoning>
```

- Opportunities
- Economic state
- Diplomatic landscape

---

## 8. Clausewitz AI Personality Overrides

The mod includes four Clausewitz personality variants that Stellaris’ native AI reads
directly.  The LLM’s decision sets stance flags, and the mod event switches the
active personality:

| Personality | Aggression | Combat Bravery | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| `overmind_controlled` | 1.0 | 1.5 | Balanced (default) |
| `overmind_controlled_aggressive` | 2.0 | 2.0 | BUILD_FLEET, PREPARE_WAR |
| `overmind_controlled_defensive` | 0.25 | 1.0 | DEFEND, CONSOLIDATE |
| `overmind_controlled_assault` | 3.0 | 3.0 | Active war (rarely retreat) |

All variants use 4.4.6 weapon meta: kinetic weapons, shields > armor,
autocannon+plasma for anti-corvette.

---

## 9. Player Mode: Strategic Advisor

In player mode, the personality system produces a **suggestion** instead of
override flags.  The suggestion includes:
- The recommended macro action (e.g. FOCUS_TECH)
- Reasoning citing ruleset elements
- Specific tips (e.g. “Build research labs on your capital”)

Displayed in the TUI’s yellow “Suggestion” panel and saved to `overmind_suggestion.txt`.
