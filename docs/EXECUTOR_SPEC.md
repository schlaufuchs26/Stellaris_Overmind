# Stellaris 4.4.6 – Action Executor Specification
The executor influences Stellaris’ native AI via Clausewitz personality overrides, stat
modifiers, and automated policy enforcement.  It does **not** bypass the native AI’s
build queues, research picks, or fleet construction — those remain under native control.

For the **player**, the engine acts as a strategic advisor: it displays suggestions
in the Rich TUI and writes `overmind_suggestion.txt`, but never executes actions.

---

## 1. Purpose
- Convert LLM macro actions into Clausewitz personality stance flags + stat modifiers.
- Override AI personality (aggressiveness, weapon preferences, combat bravery) based on directive.
- Enforce policies and edicts matching the strategic directive.
- Prevent modifier stacking (clear all previous modifiers before each action).
- Support per-country scoping for multi-empire AI mode.
- In **player mode**, display human-readable suggestions (no direct execution).

**Key principle**: the LLM decides *what* to prioritise; Stellaris’ native AI decides
*how* to execute it (which districts to build, which techs to pick, etc.).

---

## 2. Accepted Actions
The LLM may output only:

```
EXPAND
BUILD_FLEET
IMPROVE_ECONOMY
FOCUS_TECH
DIPLOMACY
ESPIONAGE
PREPARE_WAR
DEFEND
CONSOLIDATE
COLONIZE
BUILD_STARBASE
```

---

## 3. Execution Pipeline

### 3.1 AI Mode: Directive → Personality Override
The Python engine writes a directive JSON audit record per AI country and, when a
command directory is configured, an atomic `overmind_directive_<country_id>.command`
file. `scripts/auto_execute.py` accepts only the generated
`event overmind.<action-event> <country_id>` command and injects it directly into
the console. The target country event then:
1. Clears all previous modifiers and stance flags (`overmind_clear_modifiers`)
2. Sets the new personality stance flag (aggressive / defensive / full assault)
3. Applies a temporary stat modifier (180 days) that nudges native AI priorities
4. Enforces relevant policies (if available for the empire type)

Stellar’s native AI then uses these personality weights + modifiers to make its own
micro-decisions (build order, research queue, fleet composition, colonisation order).

The transport never runs arbitrary command files, calls `play`, grants resources, or
adds districts/buildings. If the injector is not running, the JSON audit record is
preserved and the directive remains pending.

### 3.2 Player Mode: Directive → Suggestion
The engine writes `overmind_suggestion.txt` with:
- The recommended action and reason
- Specific tips for what the player should do (e.g. “Build research labs on your capital”)
- Displayed prominently in the Rich TUI’s yellow “Suggestion” panel

No console commands or mod effects are executed for the player.

### 3.3 Mod Event
The injected action event `overmind.101` through `overmind.111` targets one country
ID, requires a default AI country, marks it Overmind-controlled, and calls the
matching scripted effect. Event `overmind.100` remains available for legacy
flag-and-variable integrations.

### 3.3 Scripted Effect
Each action effect:
1. Calls `overmind_clear_modifiers` (removes all 11 previous modifiers + personality flags)
2. Sets personality stance flag (`overmind_aggressive` / `overmind_defensive` / `overmind_full_assault`)
3. Applies temporary modifier (180 days)
4. Enforces relevant policies (if available for the empire type)

### 3.4 AI Personality Override
Four Clausewitz personality variants (weight 10000–30000):
- `overmind_controlled` — balanced (kinetic weapons, shields > armor, combat_bravery=1.5)
- `overmind_controlled_aggressive` — aggressiveness=2.0, military_spending=1.5, conqueror+dominator
- `overmind_controlled_defensive` — aggressiveness=0.25, high diplomatic acceptance
- `overmind_controlled_assault` — combat_bravery=3.0 (rarely retreat), during active wars

---

## 5. Validation Layer
Reject actions if:
- They violate fog‑of‑war
- They contradict origin/civic rules
- They require unseen information
- They reference forbidden weapons (disruptors, arc emitters)

---

## 6. Execution Timing
- Personality overrides applied live via mod events (no pausing)
- AI empires: the command injector applies one targeted event per pending directive
  as soon as Stellaris is available; the legacy monthly event remains supported
- Player: suggestion displayed after each LLM decision (~3s with Ollama)
- Cooldown: mod event fires monthly; engine polls every 2s for new saves
- Empire config auto-detected from save file (no manual setup needed)
